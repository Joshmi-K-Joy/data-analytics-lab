# 🌧️ Rainfall Prediction Project

This project is part of **Module 13: Rainfall Prediction** assignment. The goal is to analyze weather data from Austin, Texas, and use a **Linear Regression model** to predict precipitation levels based on various weather features.

## 📁 Dataset Used
- **austin_weather.csv**  
  Contains daily historical weather information like temperature, humidity, dew point, visibility, wind speed, and precipitation levels in inches.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess weather data
- Handle missing values and symbols like 'T' or '-'
- Analyze the relationships between weather attributes
- Train a **Linear Regression** model using `sklearn` to predict `PrecipitationSumInches`
- Visualize trends and correlations using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`

## 🔧 Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn

## 🧪 Model
- **Linear Regression** was used to predict rainfall (PrecipitationSumInches)
- Evaluated using Mean Squared Error and R² Score

## 📊 Results
- Achieved a reasonable accuracy with the linear model
- Found clear correlations between precipitation and weather attributes like temperature, dew point, and humidity
